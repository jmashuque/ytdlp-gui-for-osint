## Overview

`yt-dlp GUI for OSINT` is a portable Windows interface I created to make yt-dlp capture workflows easier, more consistent, and more approachable for OSINT users working inside managed organizations.

The app is intentionally narrow in scope. It wraps an approved local PowerShell and yt-dlp workflow, adds case organization and review helpers, and avoids acting as a downloader, installer, scraper, browser automation tool, or evidence analysis suite.

## Intended Users

This app is intended for investigators, analysts, or support staff who need a repeatable way to collect media or metadata using yt-dlp without manually assembling command-line arguments each time.

It assumes the user is working under their organization's policies and has authorization to perform the captures they are attempting.

## What the App Does

The app provides a guided interface for:

- selecting required local tools and paths, including `script.ps1`, `yt-dlp.exe`, optional cookies, FFmpeg, and the Output Root
- entering or templating case names with tags such as `%date%` and `%time%`
- pasting URLs directly, using an input URL file, and optionally stripping parameter-like ampersand tags from pasted URLs
- selecting VPN/network adapter checks when required
- running preflight checks before capture
- choosing capture behavior such as source scope, archive mode, date filters, max resolution, sidecar artifacts, title keyword filters, failure handling, request pacing, and optional download speed limiting
- using supported browser impersonation targets, with an option to view all targets returned by yt-dlp
- opening, browsing, sorting, filtering, and reviewing case folders through the Case Browser
- generating GUI thumbnails and cached media details when FFmpeg and FFprobe are available
- verifying case files against the latest SHA256 manifest
- copying a successful case summary with relevant tool and script version information
- saving settings and reusable profiles

The goal is to reduce mistakes, make captures more repeatable, and keep the workflow understandable for users who are not comfortable building commands manually.

## What the App Does Not Do

The app does not:

- include or distribute yt-dlp, FFmpeg, Deno, Python, or any other binaries
- download binaries automatically
- bypass organizational security controls
- bypass website access controls
- perform credential collection
- automate logins
- perform browser automation
- perform content analysis
- perform identity matching
- determine whether a capture is legally or organizationally authorized

The app only helps run a local, approved capture workflow.

## Organizational Compatibility

This app is designed for managed environments. It does **not** bundle downloaded binaries and does **not** fetch executables from the internet.

All required tools should be obtained, reviewed, and staged separately according to the organization's process. The app should operate as a wrapper around approved local tools, not as a downloader or installer.

## Required Components

The following components must be present or provided separately:

- Python
- the Python GUI script, `gui.py`
- the PowerShell capture script, `script.ps1`
- `yt-dlp.exe`
- `ffmpeg.exe`
- `ffprobe.exe`
- `deno.exe`

Place `deno.exe` in the same folder as `yt-dlp.exe`. From the source repos/build packages, keep only the required binaries for this app: `yt-dlp.exe`, `deno.exe`, `ffmpeg.exe`, and `ffprobe.exe`. Other bundled files can be omitted or deleted after staging the needed executables.

Python may require administrative privileges to install, depending on the organization's software installation policies. For standard Windows users, I recommend installing Python through the Microsoft Store / Python install manager where permitted by policy:

- Microsoft Store - Python: <https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PNRBTZXMB4Z>
- Microsoft Store - Python Install Manager: <https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NQ7512CXL7T>

The GUI script and PowerShell script should stay together in the same portable app folder unless the paths are intentionally changed in the GUI.

All required binaries, including yt-dlp, FFmpeg, and Deno, should be official signed releases whenever available. They should be downloaded only from trusted official sources and staged by IT or another approved process.

Recommended source pages:

- yt-dlp nightly builds: <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds/releases>
- Deno releases: <https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases>
- FFmpeg Windows builds by Gyan.dev: <https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/>

For FFmpeg, use the Gyan.dev **release essentials** build unless you specifically need the larger full build. The essentials release includes the expected `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` tools used by this app.

## Basic Usage

1. Extract or place the app files in a local non-synced folder, such as a folder outside OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive, or other cloud sync locations.
2. Launch the app by running `gui.py`.
   - If `.py` files are associated with Python, double-click `gui.py`.
   - Otherwise, open the app folder in File Explorer, click the address bar, type `cmd`, press Enter, then run `python gui.py`.
   - If `python` is not available from that terminal, try `py gui.py`.
3. Confirm the paths for the PowerShell script, yt-dlp, optional cookies file, Output Root, and FFmpeg folder.
4. Set the Output Root to a local non-synced folder so captures, logs, manifests, and GUI cache files are not actively synchronized while captures are running.
5. Enter a case name or template. The default is `Case-%date%`; use **Insert Tag** for tags such as `%date%`, `%time%`, `%datetime%`, `%year%`, `%month%`, `%day%`, `%hour%`, `%minute%`, and `%second%`.
6. Paste URLs into the URL box or select an input file. The URL box takes priority if both are used.
7. Select the VPN/network adapter used for the capture, if applicable.
8. Press **Check VPN** to verify that the selected VPN/network adapter is connected, if VPN checking is enabled.
9. Run **Preflight Check** to confirm required files exist and determine whether the existing yt-dlp, FFmpeg, FFprobe, and Deno binaries are allowed to execute.
10. Start the capture with **Start Capture**.
11. Review the output log.
12. Open the case folder using **Open**, or use **Tools > Open Case Browser** to review case folders, thumbnails, media details, sidecar files, summaries, and manifest verification.

Case name templates are resolved when capture starts. The resolved case folder is previewed below the Case Name field, and the app warns before using an existing populated folder.

## Profiles and Settings

The app stores settings and profiles in a portable JSON settings file beside the app.

The **Default** profile is always loaded on startup and is used for normal persistent settings. Custom profiles can be created, loaded, saved, and deleted from the Profile menu.

App-level settings include Delete Cookies on Exit, Check VPN, Dark Mode, and Case Browser preferences such as filter, sort, icon scale, and current-folder-only view. These are not profile-specific. Use Cookies File is profile-specific.

The settings file uses a schema version. When an older settings file is loaded, recognized values are imported, new recognized values are created with defaults, and unrecognized values are preserved under `unrecognized_settings`.

Settings saves are skipped when the JSON payload has not changed to avoid unnecessary output log noise. Resetting defaults only resets the Default profile; deleting the settings file requires confirmation because it removes saved profiles and resets the current GUI settings.

## Cookies Handling

The app can optionally reference a cookies file and includes helper options to export, encrypt, decrypt, or delete the selected cookies file on exit.

Cookies files should be treated as sensitive because a raw cookies file may function like a browser session. The app does not display cookie contents in the GUI.

The Cookies File row includes a **Use** checkbox. When disabled, the cookies path field and Browse button are disabled, the cookies file is not passed to the capture script, and preflight skips cookies file validation.

**Use Cookies File** is a profile-level setting. **Delete Cookies on Exit** is an app-level setting, not a profile setting. When Delete Cookies on Exit is enabled, the app attempts to delete the file currently shown in the Cookies File field when the GUI closes.

## Limitations

The app depends on both `gui.py` and `script.ps1`, along with locally staged binaries. If those files or tools are missing, blocked, outdated, unsigned, or not permitted by policy, the app may not function.

The preflight check confirms common prerequisites, including whether yt-dlp, FFmpeg, FFprobe, and Deno can execute in the current environment. It cannot guarantee that every target URL will be accessible or capturable.

The VPN check only confirms whether the selected adapter is up. It does not prove that traffic is routed through the VPN.

The Case Browser uses FFmpeg for thumbnails and FFprobe for cached media details. If either tool is unavailable, fallback placeholders or unavailable media details are shown. Case file verification runs only for a selected case folder or one of its subfolders; the Output Root itself cannot be verified. The GUI cache and manifests folders are excluded from SHA256 verification scope: `.gui-cache` contains regenerated display/cache data, and `manifests` contains verification records rather than captured evidence.

The update checker only queries GitHub for the latest app release and opens the release page for manual download. It does not download, extract, replace, or run files.

The optional **Strip** button in the URL box controls decodes common HTML ampersands such as `&amp;` and removes trailing parameter-like segments that match `&name=`.

Download speed limiting is disabled by default. When enabled in Advanced Options, the app passes yt-dlp's `--limit-rate` option with the selected preset or a custom value such as `750K`, `20M`, or `1.5M`.

The app is only a workflow wrapper. It does not make authorization, policy, or legal decisions.
