# Changelog

Notable user-facing changes to WAVI Capture GUI for OSINT are listed below.

## [v3.2026.0831](https://github.com/jmashuque/wavi-capture-gui-for-osint/releases/tag/v3.2026.0831) - Profile Capture, Scope Controls, and Smarter Recovery

- Renamed Image Capture to Gallery/Profile Capture and expanded its workflow around profile, timeline, gallery, album, post, and other supported gallery-dl media collection sources.
- Added Gallery/Profile scope controls with selectable common keywords and custom comma-separated values, allowing supported gallery-dl extractors to target content such as posts, stories, reels, highlights, avatars, timelines, videos, tagged content, and other site-specific scopes.
- Expanded Gallery/Profile capture modes with separate Media + selected metadata, Media only, and Metadata/artifacts only options.
- Changed URL-box saving across Audio/Video, Gallery/Profile, and Webpage Capture to explicit Save As behaviour so the currently selected Input File is never silently overwritten.
- Improved Audio/Video and Webpage recovery with sparse URL continuation, allowing failed or interrupted jobs to retry only unresolved original URLs while preserving completed results and Webpage per-URL classifications. Gallery/Profile jobs retain archive-backed retry behaviour.

## [v3.2026.0816](https://github.com/jmashuque/wavi-capture-gui-for-osint/releases/tag/v3.2026.0816) - Capture Reliability, Recovery, and Evidence Integrity

- Improved Audio/Video and Image Capture failure handling so failed URLs and yt-dlp processing errors produce authoritative job results, while Image metadata-only captures now use the normal gallery-dl processing path without suppressing later media downloads.
- Strengthened direct-capture and Job Queue process ownership, Stop and shutdown behaviour, interrupted-job recovery, setup-failure persistence, and Webpage per-URL classification recovery.
- Improved queue concurrency and archive safety by preserving each job’s captured concurrency limits, reserving engines for active direct captures, serializing Audio/Video universal-archive use, and preventing Partial Webpage captures from suppressing later cross-case attempts.
- Improved evidence integrity with finalized run-log hashing, case-relative manifest paths, cross-engine manifest verification, relocated-case support, and combined verification across Audio/Video, Image, and Webpage manifests.
- Reworked yt-dlp impersonation targets around the capabilities reported by the installed tool, with dynamic browser-family and exact client/OS choices, unavailable-target filtering, and corrected exact-target forwarding.
- Improved capture repeatability and validation by removing forced Audio/Video browser/language headers, isolating yt-dlp and gallery-dl from unrelated external configuration files, validating writable Output Roots and enabled cookie files, and rejecting Windows-invalid resolved case names.
- Improved Case Browser root handling so it follows the most recently completed capture across all three engines while retaining manual Audio/Video Output Root control.
- Improved runtime stability and diagnostics with live gallery-dl Output Log streaming, safer background-worker state snapshots, abandoned Webpage browser-profile cleanup, and targeted logging for persistence, recovery, archive, and temporary-file failures.

## [v3.2026.0725](https://github.com/jmashuque/wavi-capture-gui-for-osint/releases/tag/v3.2026.0725) - Interactive Webpage Capture, Safety, and PDF Browsing

- Added optional Interactive Overlays capture with packaged whitelist and blacklist rules, bounded page scanning, media-readiness checks, per-item evidence reporting, automatic dismissal, and same-origin route capture for post, reel, photo, story, and highlight pages.
- Added Overlay only, Viewport only, and Overlay and viewport output modes, plus a separate interactive filename template with `%urlindex%`, `%overlayindex%`, `%profile%`, and `%contentid%` tags.
- Added `%profile%` support to standard Webpage Capture filename templates.
- Hardened automated webpage interaction with stricter candidate qualification, immutable blocking of social and account actions, same-origin media-route preference, pre-click descriptor revalidation, movement checks, topmost-element hit testing, and detailed safety records.
- Changed interactive capture to run before PDF generation so Captured PNG PDF staging cannot replace the live webpage before interactive scanning.
- Added PDF filtering and default-viewer opening to Case Browser, and improved Case Browser refresh behavior when the Output Root changes.
- Added clearer inactive-tab shading to the main GUI tabs in light and dark modes.

## [v2.2026.0722](https://github.com/jmashuque/wavi-capture-gui-for-osint/releases/tag/v2.2026.0722) - Output Log and Capture Layout Improvements

- Added a dedicated Output Log tab for live Audio/Video, Image, Webpage, and combined capture output, with follow, copy, save, and clear controls.
- Removed the embedded output logs from the capture tabs and reduced the main window height for a more compact layout.
- Added dynamically scrollable option panels across all capture engines, with Close buttons positioned directly after each panel’s content.
- Fixed option panels occasionally appearing blank the first time they were opened.
- Changed startup behavior to reopen the last selected capture tab rather than a queue, log, preview, or browser tab.
- Added automatic collapsing of capture option panels when switching away from their capture tab.

## [v2.2026.0721](https://github.com/jmashuque/wavi-capture-gui-for-osint/releases/tag/v2.2026.0721) - Large PDF Reliability and Window Placement

- Added streamed, atomic PDF writing with bounded memory use, partial-file cleanup, and improved browser/CDP failure diagnostics.
- Added automatic or manual Live Page PDF splitting with numbered parts, safety limits, preserved completed parts, and PDF-set metadata.
- Fixed main-window position persistence, including multi-monitor and off-screen recovery.
- Improved first-launch placement so the full interface remains visible above the taskbar.

- Standardized all three capture tabs with the same twelve URL-management tools and captured/failed history support.
- Added the optional `%engine%` tag for case-name and filename templates.
- Added persistent active profiles, profile-specific autosaving, selected tab, window geometry, and maximized-window state.

## [v2.2026.0713](https://github.com/jmashuque/wavi-capture-gui-for-osint/releases/tag/v2.2026.0713) - Webpage Cookies, Archives, and Browser Selection

## [v0.2026.0616](https://github.com/jmashuque/wavi-capture-gui-for-osint/releases/tag/v0.2026.0616) - Playlist Preview, URL Persistence, and Case Browser Polish

- Added the **Playlist Preview** tab with manual checked/selected preview scans, request pacing, rate-limit/backoff warnings, playlist/item checkmarks, playlist-split queueing, JSON export, and context menus.
- Added `%playlist%` case-name tag support and automatic playlist-title case naming for Playlist Preview queue jobs.

- Improved the **Case Browser** with better filename wrapping and dynamic file-card columns that reflow with available pane width.
- Refreshed README usage sections around the four main tabs while keeping prior changelog entries intact.

## [v0.2026.0614](https://github.com/jmashuque/wavi-capture-gui-for-osint/releases/tag/v0.2026.0614) - Tabs, Presets, Proxy, and Output Records

- Added a bottom-tab workflow for **Capture**, **Job Queue**, and **Case Browser**, with Case Browser loading the selected Output Root in the background and supporting Domain sort.
- Expanded input and queue workflows with multiple Input Files, queue checkmarks, Start Selected, split-and-add-to-queue, persisted jobs, interrupted job handling, and clearer active preset visibility.
- Reworked Domain Presets so presets use names plus one or more match domains, support priority ordering, import conflict choices, and expose matching preset information in the queue.
- Added app-level Proxy Options with protocol/address/port/credential fields, optional session-only storage, script-side proxy validation, and masked proxy logging.
- Added Output Records controls for Case Browser cache timing and file manifest scope; script success now follows yt-dlp results while cache warnings remain non-fatal.
- Improved responsiveness and cleanup by moving Case Browser scans/cache work off the main UI path, chunking large Case Browser renders, deferring startup work, and removing stale hidden UI/menu code.

## [v0.2026.0612](https://github.com/jmashuque/wavi-capture-gui-for-osint/releases/tag/v0.2026.0612) - Queue, URL Workflow, and Advanced Controls

- Changed queued jobs to run from snapshotted job settings without rewriting the visible main GUI fields.
- Changed the default case name template to `Case-%datetime%`.
- Updated URL box saving to always prompt with a Save As dialog.
- Refined case summaries and verification so manifest files are counted in summaries while `.gui-cache` and `manifests` remain outside verification scope.

- Added logging for whether a cookies file is provided or disabled.

### Case Browser Verification

- Excluded `.gui-cache` and `manifests` from SHA256 manifest generation and verification scope.
- Updated case file verification to ignore `.gui-cache` and `manifests` paths, including older manifests that may reference cache files.
- Changed Verify Case Files so Output Root cannot be verified directly; users must select a case folder or one of its subfolders.

## [v0.2026.0528](https://github.com/jmashuque/wavi-capture-gui-for-osint/releases/tag/v0.2026.0528) - Workflow Polish, Preflight Validation, and Case Browser Refinements
